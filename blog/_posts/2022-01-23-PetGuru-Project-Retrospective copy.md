## Looking Back the PetGuru project

  ![MainPage](../assets/img/PetGuru/Website/07. Main Page.png)

This was the second group project I experienced in the CodeStates bootcamp. In this project, I worked with 3 other teammates, and participated as the Back-end web developer. During the 6 weeks, our team worked as a group and went through all the process from the service planning to the website building. Below are the things I felt while going through this first group project.
