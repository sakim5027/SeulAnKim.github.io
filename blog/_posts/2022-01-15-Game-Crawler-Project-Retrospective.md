## Looking Back the CodeStates 4-week project

This was the first group project I experienced in the CodeStates bootcamp. In this project, I worked with 2 other teammates, and participated as the Front-end web developer. During the 4 weeks, our team worked as a group and went through all the process from the service planning to the website building. Below are the things I felt while going through this first group project.

### Experience with Git

Since this was my first group project, this was the first time I experienced the **Git** in group settings. During this project, we learned **Version Control System** by creating & managing different branches within git to work on the different features of the project. At first, it took us hours and hours in fixing the messed up Git branches, since everyone was inexperienced with the git. But as time went by, we got used to using git in handling the branches, and got into a habit of pulling the upstream before pushing my local branches to upstream. Below are some of the git features I used & experienced:

- **git remote add (upstream) (url)** : Add the specific url as the upstream repository
- **git branch** : checking the list of branches I have
- **git branch (branchname)** : create a branch named (branchname)
- **git branch -m (oldbranch) (newbranch)** : change the branch name from (oldbranch) to (newbranch)
- **git branch -d (branchname)** : delete the branch named (branchname)
- **git checkout (branch)** : move to the named branch
- **git checkout -b (branch)** : create a branch and move to the new branch
- **git status** : seeing the status of modified files in the working directory
- **git add (filename)** : add(stage) the file in the working directory to the staging area
- **git add .** : add(stage) all the files in the working directory to the staging area
- **git commit -m '(commit message)'** : create the snapshot of what changes were made to the repository.
- **git pull (upstream) (branch)** : pull from the upstream branch into the local repository
- **git push (origin) (branch)** : push the local branch to the upstream repository


### Login Modal

During this project, I could experience creating a Login Modal using React, without using any outside UI frameworks such as styled components or bootstrap components. 

### Importance of Teamwork & Communication

### Pressure of Deadline
