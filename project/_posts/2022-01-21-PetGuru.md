## 2) Final Website & Features

Below are the fianl website we created and the main features.

- Landing Page
- Sign Up
- Website Login
- OAuth Login
- Guest Login
- Log Out
- Main Page (Missing Animals List)
- Creating a Missing Animals Post
- Reading a Missing Animals Post
- Updating a Missing Animals Post
- Deleting a Missing Animals Post
- Infinite Scroll


<br>

### 2-1) Landing Page

  ![LandingPage](../assets/img/PetGuru/07. petguru-landingPage.gif)

This is the **Landing Page** of our website. Since the Landing Page is where people first see when they visit our website, we added the brief information about our website, and the services we provide in the Landing Page. If the visitors are interested in our service, they can either **Sign Up** or do the **Guest Login** and further look around our website.


<br>

### 2-2) Sign Up

  ![RegisterUser](../assets/img/PetGuru/02. petguru-registerUser.gif)

If the visitors decide to create an account with us, they can simply click on the **Sign Up** button on the top right corner. This will lead them to the Sign Up page, where they can create an account with us. They need to provide their name, email and password, and if there is no problem with the provided information, they are automatically logged in. We could direct them back to the Login page and asking them to log in using the account they just created, but we decided to do the automatic login after sign up for the user convenience purposes.

<br>

### 2-3) Website Login

  ![Login](../assets/img/PetGuru/03. petguru-login.gif)

If the visitors already have account with us, they can **Log In** using their account. They only need to type in the email associated with the account, and the password. 

<br>

### 2-4) ID & Password Search

  ![IdPwSearch](../assets/img/GameCrawlers/07. GameCrawler_Id&Pw Search.png)

If you click onto the **Find your ID / Password** button in the Login Modal, you will be directed to the **ID & Password Search** page. In this page, you can find your ID using your registered email, or find your password using your ID and email. All information will be mailed out to the registered email, and you can check your lost ID or password in your email.

<br>

### 2-5) Sign Up Page

  ![SignUp](../assets/img/GameCrawlers/05. GameCrawler_Sign Up.png)

If you click onto the **Sign Up** button in the Login Modal, you will be directed to the **Sign Up Page**. In this page, you can create a new ID, password, nickname and register your email associated with the ID. Also, you get to choose your favorite game genre.

When creating the ID and password, you need to go through the **validation check**. Your ID needs to be between 4-12 letters including Capitals & numbers, and it should also pass the **duplicate check**. Your password, in other hand, needs to be between 6-12 letters including Capitals & numbers, and the same password needs to be entered twice. This process is shown in below gif image:

  ![IdPwCheck](../assets/img/GameCrawlers/06. GameCrawler_Id&Pw Check.gif) 

In this image, you can see that the web does the validation check and shows the appropriate alert messages below the input box as you enter the ID & password.


<br>

### 2-6) MyPage

  ![MyPage](../assets/img/GameCrawlers/04. GameCrawler_MyPage_2.png)

Once you successfully created your new ID, you will be directed to **MyPage**. In this page, you can see your user information, such as nickname, email and favorite genre. If you wrote any game reviews in the past, it will also be show up in this page uner **My Reviews**. 


  ![MyPageUpdate](../assets/img/GameCrawlers/04-1. GameCrawler_MyPage Update.png)

If you want to update your user information, you can click onto the update button and it will direct you to the **User Info Update** page. In this page, you can change your nickname, password, favorite genre or associated email. When you are changing the password, you will have to go through the **validation check** again, and the same password needs to be entered twice as well.


<br>

### 2-7) Responsive Web Design

  ![ResponsiveWeb1](../assets/img/GameCrawlers/08. GameCrawler_Responsive Web Design_1.gif)

While creating the Game Crawler website, we could successfully implement the **Responsive Web Design** using the media query in CSS. As you can see from the above gif image, the game list in the landing page re-arranges as the page gets smaller.


  ![ResponsiveWeb2](../assets/img/GameCrawlers/08. GameCrawler_Responsive Web Design_2.gif)

When the screen is small, the navigation bar menus ultimately becomes an icon on the top right corner. In this mode, you can click onto the icon and it will show up the navigation bar menus in the drop-down. The drop-down menu works the same as it was in the wide view, and you can see it directs to the correct page as intented.



<br>

## 3) Retrospective

With lack of time, we could not finish all the goals we initially set at the start of the project. (For example, review page and statistic page could not be completed until the project deadline.) However, I am glad I could come up with my first website that actually works with basic features. For the detailed retrospective, please see my blog post **Game Crawler Project Retrospective**.
