## 2) Final Website & Features

Below are the fianl website we created and the main features.

- Landing Page
- Sign Up
- Website Login
- O-Auth Login
- Guest Login
- Log Out
- Main Page
- Creating a Missing Pet Post
- Reading a Missing Pet Post
- Updating a Missing Pet Post
- Deleting a Missing Pet Post
- Infinite Scroll


<br>

### 2-1) Landing Page

  ![LandingPage](../assets/img/PetGuru/Website/01. petguru-landingPage.gif)

This is the **Landing Page** of our website. Since the Landing Page is where people first see when they visit our website, we added the brief information about our website, and the services we provide in the Landing Page. If the visitors are interested in our service, they can either **Sign Up** or do the **Guest Login** and further look around our website.

The website was designed with separate Landing page and Main page for the purpose of getting maximum registered users. However, we were also aware of the cases where visitors do not want to create account but still wanting to explore our services. This made us create the Guest Login feature, with which people can explore our website freely without the authority to write a Missing Pets Post or Reply. If our service was satisfactory and visitors want to write a Missing Pets Post or Reply the Post, they will now have to create an account with us.


<br>

### 2-2) Sign Up

  ![RegisterUser](../assets/img/PetGuru/Website/02. petguru-registerUser.gif)

If the visitors decide to create an account with us, they can simply click on the **Sign Up** button on the top right corner. This will lead them to the Sign Up page, where they can create an account with us. They need to provide their name, email and password, and if there is no problem with the provided information, they are automatically logged in. We could direct them back to the Login page and asking them to log in using the account they just created, but we decided to do the automatic login after sign up for the user convenience purposes.

<br>

### 2-3) Website Login

  ![Login](../assets/img/PetGuru/Website/03. petguru-login.gif)

If the visitors already have account with us, they can **Log In** using their account. They only need to type in the email associated with the account, and the password. Once they provide the correct information, the **Log In Successful!** message pops up and they are directed to the **Main Page**.

<br>

### 2-4) O-Auth Login

  ![OAuthLogin](../assets/img/PetGuru/Website/04. petguru-googleLogin.gif)

If the visitors want to create the account using their Google email, they can click the **Google Login** button and Google O-Auth Login page will pop up. From there, they can select their existing google email and their account using the google email is automatically created. If the O-Auth login was successful, **Log In Successful!** message pops up and they are directed to the **Main Page**.

<br>

### 2-5) Guest Login

  ![GuestLogin](../assets/img/PetGuru/Website/05. petguru-guestLogin.gif)

If the visitors are not willing to create the account with us, they can simply click on the **Guest Log In** button from the Log In page, then **Guest Log In Successful!** message pops up and they are directed to the **Main Page** automatically. With this guest account, they can explore our website freely, but cannot write a Missing Pets Post or Reply the post.


<br>

### 2-6) Log Out

  ![Logout](../assets/img/PetGuru/Website/06. petguru-logout.gif)

If the visitors want to log out of the website, they can click the **Logout** button on the top right corner, and the **Log Out Successful!** message pops up. Then, they are automatically directed to the Landing Page. In this way, we can make sure that the users can use our service only when they log in to their account or do the guest login. 

<br>

### 2-7) Main Page

  ![MainPage](../assets/img/PetGuru/Website/07. Main Page.png)

This is the **Main Page** visitors can see after they log in. The Main Page is pretty straight-forward, with a big **Report a Missing Pet** button on top and a search bar. Below this, all the registered Missing Pets Posts are shown as a card post, with their brief information such as pet's photo, name, breed and sex. This enables the user to see the all registered animals at once with ease.

<br>

### 2-8) Creating a Missing Pet Post

  ![CreatePost](../assets/img/PetGuru/Website/06. petguru-addMissingPost.gif)

If the use click onto the **Report a Missing Pet** button, they are directed to the Post Write form. In this form, they can type in the name and breed of the missing pet, and select the sex of the pet. Then, they can use the map on the right to pin-point the area where the pet was lost, then select the missing date. User can also provide the birth year of the pet and upload the photo of the missing pet. Then, they can write in detail freely in the text box below about the lost pet. Once every information is provided, user can click **submit** then the **Missing Pet Posting Successful!** message pops up. Then, you can see that the new card post is registered in the Main Page.

## 3) Retrospective

With lack of time, we could not finish all the goals we initially set at the start of the project. (For example, review page and statistic page could not be completed until the project deadline.) However, I am glad I could come up with my first website that actually works with basic features. For the detailed retrospective, please see my blog post **Game Crawler Project Retrospective**.
